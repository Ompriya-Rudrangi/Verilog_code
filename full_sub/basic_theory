###  Basic Theory of Full Subtractor
A **full subtractor** is a combinational circuit that performs subtraction of three binary inputs:  
- **A** (minuend)  
- **B** (subtrahend)  
- **C** (borrow in)  

It produces two outputs:  
- **Difference (D)** → result of ( A - B - C )  
- **Borrow out (B0)** → indicates if a borrow is needed for the next higher bit  

#### Logic Equations:
- Difference:  
                           D = A ^ B ^ C
- Borrow out:  
                     B0 = (~A&B) + (B&C) + (~A&C)
                     
#### Key Points:
- Similar to a full adder, but instead of carry, it generates **borrow**.  
- Can be implemented using **two half subtractors** or by modifying a **full adder with 2’s complement logic**.  
- Essential in arithmetic circuits like subtractors, ALUs, and digital processors.
