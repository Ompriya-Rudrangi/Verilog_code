## Ripple Carry Adder (RCA) – Basic Theory

--> What is a Ripple Carry Adder?

 Ripple Carry Adder (RCA)---"combinational digital circuit" used to add two multi-bit binary numbers. 
                           It is built by "cascading multiple full adders", where the "carry output of one stage becomes the carry input of the next stage".

The carry signal “ripples” from the **least significant bit (LSB)** to the **most significant bit (MSB)**, which is why it is called a *ripple* carry adder.

###  Basic Structure

* Consists of **N full adders** for adding **N-bit numbers**
* Inputs:

  * Two N-bit binary numbers: **A = Aₙ₋₁…A₀**, **B = Bₙ₋₁…B₀**
  * Initial carry input: **C₀ (usually 0)**
* Outputs:

  * Sum bits: **Sₙ₋₁…S₀**
  * Final carry output: **Cₙ**

Each full adder performs:

* **Sum:** `S = A ⊕ B ⊕ Cin`
* **Carry:** `Cout = AB + BCin + ACin`

---

###  Working Principle

1. The **LSB full adder** adds A₀, B₀, and C₀.
2. It produces **S₀** and carry **C₁**.
3. **C₁** is passed to the next full adder.
4. This process continues until the MSB.
5. The final carry **Cₙ** indicates overflow.

### ⏱️ Delay Characteristics

* The **main drawback** of RCA is **propagation delay**
* Total delay ∝ **number of bits (N)**
* Worst-case delay occurs when carry must propagate through **all full adders**

[
T_{delay} = N \times T_{carry}
]

### Advantages

* Simple design
* Easy to implement
* Requires **less hardware**
* Suitable for **small-bit adders**

---

###  Disadvantages

* Slow for large bit-widths
* Carry propagation causes **high latency**
* Not suitable for high-speed processors

---

### Applications

* Small arithmetic units
* Low-power and low-area designs
* Educational and basic digital systems
* Used where **speed is not critical**
