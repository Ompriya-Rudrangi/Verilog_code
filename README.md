Verilog & SystemVerilog Digital Design Projects

This repository contains my collection of Verilog and SystemVerilog projects developed as part of my learning and practice in  "Digital Design" and "Design Verification".
Each project includes both the design module and its corresponding testbench, with simulation results documented for clarity.

---> Contents
- Multiplexers: 2:1, 3:1, and hierarchical implementations  
- Demultiplexers: 1:4 using 1:2 structure  
- Encoders & Decoders: Priority encoder, 2-to-4 decoder  
- Adders: Full adder, 4-bit adder/subtractor, carry look-ahead adder  
- Converters: Binary ↔ Gray code converters  
- Counters: Synchronous counters using T flip-flops  
- Shift Registers: Universal shift register implementation  
- Pseudo-Random Generators: LFSR-based designs  

--->  Features
- Clean modular code with clear hierarchy  
- Testbenches for each design to validate functionality  
- Simulation workflows (EDA Playground/QuestaSim) linked where applicable  
- Organized folder structure for easy navigation  

---> Purpose
This repository reflects my "hands-on training in Design Verification at MasterVLSI" and my continuous practice in building, debugging, and refining digital logic modules. 
It serves as both a learning portfolio and a showcase of practical coding skills in hardware description languages.
