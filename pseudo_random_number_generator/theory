--> Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) 

## Introduction
A "Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR)" is a sequential circuit that generates a sequence of bits using shift registers and feedback logic. 
The feedback is a linear function of the register’s previous state, most commonly implemented using the XOR operation. 
LFSRs are widely used in digital systems for pseudo-random number generation, cryptography,error detection (CRC), and spread-spectrum communication.

## Working Principle:
- An LFSR consists of:
  - A shift register of length "n".
  - A set of "tap positions" (selected bits of the register).
  - A feedback function (usually XOR of tap bits).
- At each clock cycle:
  1. The register shifts its contents.
  2. The feedback bit is computed from the tap positions.
  3. The feedback bit is inserted into the least significant bit (LSB).

## Example: 4-bit LFSR
Consider a 4-bit LFSR with taps at positions 3 and 2:
- Feedback = q[3] ^ q[2]
- output q= q<<1;
- Update rule:  
- Starting from seed `1111`, the sequence evolves as:
  ```
  1111 → 1110 → 1101 → 1011 → 0111 → 1110 → ...
  ```
- This sequence cycles through 15 unique states before repeating (all states except `0000`).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Properties
- "Periodicity": An *n*-bit LFSR can generate up to (2^n - 1\) states before repeating, if taps are chosen correctly (maximal-length sequence).
- "Deterministic but pseudo-random": The sequence looks random but is fully determined by the initial seed and tap positions.
- Applications:
  - Pseudo-random number generation.
  - Scrambling/whitening sequences in communication systems.
  - Built-in self-test (BIST) in VLSI.
  - Error detection codes (CRC).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Advantages
- Simple hardware implementation (just shift registers + XOR gates).
- High speed and low resource usage.
- Long pseudo-random sequences with proper tap selection.

## Limitations
- Not truly random (deterministic).
- Sequence length depends on tap positions.
- Cannot generate the all-zero state (once entered, it stays stuck).

---

## Conclusion
LFSRs are elegant and efficient circuits for generating pseudo-random sequences. 
By carefully selecting tap positions, they can achieve maximal-length sequences, making them invaluable in digital design, cryptography, and communication systems.
