Carry-lookahead adders (CLA) accelerate addition by computing carries in parallel using propagate and generate signals, avoiding the ripple delay of simple adders. 
A CLA reduces carry computation depth from linear to logarithmic with hierarchical grouping, delivering significantly faster addition for wide word sizes.

--> Overview
A CLA accelerates binary addition by computing carries in parallel via propagate (P) and generate (G) signals, reducing carry depth from linear (ripple) to logarithmic with hierarchical grouping.

### Equations
- P_i = A_i ⊕ B_i
- G_i = A_i · B_i
- S_i = P_i ⊕ C_i
- C_{i+1} = G_i ∨ (P_i · C_i)

4-bit carries:
C1 = G0 ∨ (P0·C0)
C2 = G1 ∨ (P1·G0) ∨ (P1·P0·C0)
C3 = G2 ∨ (P2·G1) ∨ (P2·P1·G0) ∨ (P2·P1·P0·C0)
C4 = G3 ∨ (P3·G2) ∨ (P3·P2·G1) ∨ (P3·P2·P1·G0) ∨ (P3·P2·P1·P0·C0)

Group:
P_grp = P3·P2·P1·P0
G_grp = G3 ∨ (P3·G2) ∨ (P3·P2·G1) ∨ (P3·P2·P1·G0)
C4 = G_grp ∨ (P_grp·C0)
